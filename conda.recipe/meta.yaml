  description: |
    STEMS is a library to help with analysis of geospatial time series data. It
    tries to integrate geospatial libraries (rasterio, fiona, and shapely) with
    the xarray library to make it easier to use netCDF4 files for large data
    processing. This library also contains functions and tools to facilitate
    processing these data with dask and distributed.
